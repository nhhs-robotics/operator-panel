# Prototype Code for Draft 2

The goal of this code is to get the HID descriptor correct for our operator panel: 

* 8-10 (figure out the right amount) buttons for the buttons and switches
* Analog inputs from the sliders
* POV input from the digital joystick



* Need to download the Adafruit hid library and copy into the lib/ dir on the Pico
